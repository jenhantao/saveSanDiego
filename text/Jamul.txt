Between 2000 and 2011 the fraction of deaths in Jamul due to these chronic diseases has fallen from 70% to 57% of all deaths on the record. The percentages seem small, but results of public efforts are responsible for saving 167 lives in a ten year span. 

We can help change this by promoting healthy behavior.  67% of our adults are overweight and 54% of our children are not getting enough fruits and vegetables.  This needs to change.
