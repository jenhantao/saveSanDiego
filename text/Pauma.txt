Between 2000 and 2011 the fraction of deaths in Pauma due to these chronic diseases has risen from 62% to 50% of all deaths on the record. The percentages seem small, but results of public efforts are responsible for costing 1 lives in a ten year span. 

We can help change this by promoting healthy behavior.  62% of our adults are overweight and 54% of our children are not getting enough fruits and vegetables.  This needs to change.
